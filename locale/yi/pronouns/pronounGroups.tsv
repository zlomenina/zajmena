Normative pronouns	ער,זי	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Normative-ish pronouns	זיי,עס‎	Those pronouns have been in common use in standard Yiddish already, but recently they got a slightly different new usage: describing a single, specific person.
Neopronouns	עז,פֿײ	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though!
