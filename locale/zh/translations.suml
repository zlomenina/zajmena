            每個人都有代詞。 這是我們用來代替名字。
            大部分人都用 {/他=“他/你”} 和 {/她=“她/你”} ，所以我們會根據人的外表自動假定要使用哪個。
            但這實際上不是那麼簡單...

            性別很複雜，有些人“看起來不像”他們的性別。
            人家喜歡的代詞跟我們想像的不一樣。
            有些人不適合當“男性”或“女性”，而更喜歡中性的語言。

            這個工具可以讓你分享你的代詞，加上例句，
            這樣你就可以讓別人看你喜歡他們怎麼叫你。
        - >
            為什麼這很重要？ 因為我們重視簡單的人類體面。
            如果你覺得“昶左”比較好聽，你也不會故意把“李強”叫成“昶左”。
            如果“昶左”是他的出生證明中的名字，
            但他絕對討厭“昶左”並且更喜歡使用“李強”你也不會把他叫成“昶左”。
            代詞是同一個故事 -
            如果你不想對某人無禮，請你使用正確的代詞。
            唯一的區別是我們通常知道名字，但不知道代詞。
            我們給自己介紹一個名字，而不是代詞。讓我們改變這種想法！

            question: 'What is nonbinary?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Gender is way more complicated than just a simple distinction male/female.
                    Even from a purely biological standpoint we distinguish chromosomal sex,
                    genetic sex, hormonal sex, phenotypic sex…
                    They aren't necessarily congruent with each other, they don't have to be binary.
                    {https://twitter.com/RebeccaRHelm/status/1207834357639139328=(more info here)}.
                    And when we get to the cultural aspect, “gender” is a social construct.
                    Depending on time and location being “a woman” or “a man” can mean having radically different
                    rights, duties, norms… In Europe men used to wear high heels and stockings
                    native peoples of North America have been recognising a third gender for centuries
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit=(two-spirit)}, etc. etc.
                - >
                    Nonbinary is an umbrella term describing the identity of people
                    who don't fit the binary man/woman distinction.
                    It includes for instance people who are
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Agender=agender},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Gender_Fluid=gender fluid},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl=demigirls},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demiboy=demiboys},
                    i {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary=and many many others}.
                - >
                    Nonbinary isn't necessarily something “between” masculinity and femininity. More like “beyond”.
                    Nonbinary people don't have to be androgynous, don't have to use neutral pronouns, etc.
                    It's about being free from gender roles, not about creating new ones.
        why-respect:
            question: 'Why should I respect some <em>strange</em> pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because addressing people in the way they want to be addressed is the basis of social relations.
                    You wouldn't call Ashley “Samantha”, you wouldn't drop “sir”/“madam” when addressing your supervisor, etc.
                    And there's people who don't want to be called either “{/he=he}” or “{/she=she}”.
                    If you don't accept that, it only shows <em>you</em> in bad light.
                - >
                    “Strange pronouns” are just a matter of getting used to.
        how-to-know:
            question: 'How do I know how to address someone?'
            answer:
                - >
                    You can just ask! Yes, it might be a bit awkward, but the more we do it, the less awkward it gets.
                    If we can ask somebody their name, why not their pronouns?
                - >
                    (Just please don't phrase it as “are you a boy or a girl?”.
                    This question implies that there's just two correct answers,
                    and it suggests unhealthy curiosity about someone's genitals.
                    Instead, you could just ask “what are your pronouns?” or “how should I refer to you?”)
                - >
                    It's also important to normalise simply telling people your pronouns when you introduce yourself.
                    “Hi, I'm Michæl, {/he=he/him}”. It's not hard – but for trans and nonbinary peopls it means so much!
                    It's even easier done online: just put your pronouns (or a link to examples from our website) to your bio.
                - >
                    Remember also that many people might use a different name and a different set of pronouns depending on situation.
                    They might not be out among friends or coworkers yet, but among friends be comfortable living their truth.
                    Be mindful. You might for instance ask them “which pronouns should I use in front of your boss?”, etc.
                - >
                    Some people give multiple pronouns, eg. “{/he&she=he/she}” or “{/they&he=they/he}”.
                    That means they like all of those forms. Usually, the first one is the preferred one.
        who-uses-it:
            question: 'Does anyone even use that?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Yes! Millions of enbies all around the world.
                    Every pronoun listed here has someone that actually uses it in everyday life.
        authority:
            question: 'Are those nonbinary pronouns approved by some kind of authority?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Language is not some kind of god-given, ancient magic set in stone.
                    It's just a tool that we use to communicate.
                    When we change as a society, and when the world around us changes,
                    we adjust the language we use to be able to better describe it.
                    We're its users, so <em>we're the authority</em> on how we want to use it.
                - >
                    Dictionaries take their time to start including those changes,
                    which doesn't make the change illegitimate in any way.
                    But eventually the new forms, if used often enough, get included in dictionaries.
                    {https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they=Merriam Webster}, for example,
                    accepts the use of {/they=singular “they”} as a nonbinary pronoun.
                - >
                    You can also read some {https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=neopronouns=academic papers}
                    on neopronouns.
        bio:
            question: 'Why should I put my pronouns in bio on social media?'
            answer:
                - >
                    If you're cis (= not trans) and you use „{/he=he}” or „{/she=she}” matching your gender,
                    you might think that your pronouns are <em>obvious</em>.
                    And yeah, maybe that's true – as long as your name is mentioned in the profile (and is traditionally male of female)
                    or if you have your picture as avatar.
                    Many people don't – so it's hard to guess how they want to be called.
                - >
                    But it's mostly about something more than that: your pronouns might be “obvious”,
                    but there are people whose pronouns are not.
                    They want to be addressed correctly, whether or not they “pass” as their gender,
                    whether or not they have transitioned (or if they want to transition at all).
                    Nonbinary people usually “don't look nonbinary”, we don't owe anyone androgyny.
                - >
                    Sharing our pronouns is very important for trans, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people.
                    Alas, it also exposes and singles us out.
                    But if cis people do the same, it means the world for us.
                    It makes us feel more confortable, safe and welcome

        change:
            question: 'Can I change my pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Of course! Nobody is surprised when someone changes their views, style, hobbies…
                    So why would it be strange that they discovered a part of their identity,
                    stopped liking their name, discovered a label that fits them well, etc.?
        get-used-to:
            question: 'Is it strange that I can''t get used to <em>my own</em> new pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Not at all! After many years of using pronouns congruent with one's gender assigned at birth
                    it's easy to forget oneself when switching to different ones.
                - >
                    Pronouns ≠ gender.
                    Your gender won't drastically change just because you got confused once when someone called you “them”.
                    Don't worry. Experiment. See what fits you best.
        preferred-pronouns:
            question: 'Why shouldn''t I say “preferred pronouns”?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because this phrase suggests that someone's pronouns are just a whim.
                    If someone just “prefers” to be called she, he won't _really_ feel bad, if I call him a “he”, right?
                    They look like a guy, after all, so it's gonna be easier for me!
                - >
                    No! It's our pronouns. Not our “preferred pronouns”. It's our names, not our “preferred names”.
                    If you care about your trans and nonbinary friends and loved ones, then call them the right way.
        gender-pronouns:
            question: 'Why shouldn''t I say “gender pronouns”?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because gender ≠ pronouns. Pronouns are just grammar.
                    Nonbinary folks can use binary pronouns, some lesbians use {/he=he/him} for cultural reasons, etc.
                - >
                    Simply say “pronouns”.
