name	pronouns	description
Normative forms	she,he	It's worth mentioning that pronouns ≠ gender. One can still be nonbinary while using pronouns that are congruent with (or opposite to) their gender assigned at birth.
Normative-ish forms	they,they/them/themself,it,one	Those pronouns have been in common use in normative English already, but recently they got a slightly different new usage: describing a single, specific person.
Neopronouns	ae,co,e,e/em/es,ey,fae,hu,ne,ne/nir,per,s/he,thon,ve,vi,xe,ze,ze/zir,zhe	Unlike the other pronouns, which are officially recognised as “grammatically correct”, albeit used in a different meaning than we're used to, neopronouns are novel. Not being included in dictionaries doesn't make them any worse, though! Some neoprouns' names are derived from the names of their creators.
