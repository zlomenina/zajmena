    about:
        - >
            We all have pronouns. They're those words that we use instead of calling someone by their name every time we mention them.
            Most people use {/he=“he/him”} and {/she=“she/her”}, so we automatically assume which one to call them based on someone's looks.
            But it's actually not that simple…
        - >
            Gender is complicated. Some people “don't look like” their gender.
            Some prefer being called in a different way from what you'd assume.
            Some people don't fit into the boxes of “male” or “female” and prefer more neutral language.
        - >
            This tool lets you share a link to your pronouns, with example sentences,
            so that you can show people how you like to be called.
        - >
            Why does it matter? Because of simple human decency.
            You wouldn't call Ashley “Samantha” just because you like that name more
            or because “she looks like a Samantha to you”.
            Or even if she <em>does</em> have the name “Samantha” in her birth certificate
            but she absolutely hates it and prefers to use “Ashley”.
            And it's the exact same story with pronouns –
            if you don't want to be rude towards someone, please address them properly.
            The only difference is that we usually know names, but not pronouns.
            We introduce ourselves with a name, but not pronouns. Let's change that!

            Inclusive and gender neutral is not just respecting someone's pronouns.
            It's also describing their job, position, relationship etc.
            in a way that doesn't assume their gender.
            Not all firefighters are “firemen”. Not every spouse is a “husband” or a “wife”.

            When referring to someone whose gender you don't know,
            to a group of people of mixed gender,
            and especially to nonbinary people who explicitly prefer them,
            use the neutral forms.

            question: 'What is nonbinary?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Gender is way more complicated than just a simple distinction male/female.
                    Even from a purely biological standpoint we distinguish chromosomal sex,
                    genetic sex, hormonal sex, phenotypic sex…
                    They aren't necessarily congruent with each other, they don't have to be binary.
                    {https://twitter.com/RebeccaRHelm/status/1207834357639139328=(more info here)}.
                    And when we get to the cultural aspect, “gender” is a social construct.
                    Depending on time and location being “a woman” or “a man” can mean having radically different
                    rights, duties, norms… In Europe men used to wear high heels and stockings
                    native peoples of North America have been recognising a third gender for centuries
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Two-Spirit=(two-spirit)}, etc. etc.
                - >
                    Nonbinary is an umbrella term describing the identity of people
                    who don't fit the binary man/woman distinction.
                    It includes for instance people who are
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Agender=agender},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Gender_Fluid=gender fluid},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demigirl=demigirls},
                    {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Demiboy=demiboys},
                    i {https://gender.wikia.org/wiki/Non-binary=and many many others}.
                - >
                    Nonbinary isn't necessarily something “between” masculinity and femininity. More like “beyond”.
                    Nonbinary people don't have to be androgynous, don't have to use neutral pronouns, etc.
                    It's about being free from gender roles, not about creating new ones.
        why-respect:
            question: 'Why should I respect some <em>strange</em> pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because addressing people in the way they want to be addressed is the basis of social relations.
                    You wouldn't call Ashley “Samantha”, you wouldn't drop “sir”/“madam” when addressing your supervisor, etc.
                    And there's people who don't want to be called either “{/he=he}” or “{/she=she}”.
                    If you don't accept that, it only shows <em>you</em> in bad light.
                - >
                    “Strange pronouns” are just a matter of getting used to.
        how-to-know:
            question: 'How do I know how to address someone?'
            answer:
                - >
                    You can just ask! Yes, it might be a bit awkward, but the more we do it, the less awkward it gets.
                    If we can ask somebody their name, why not their pronouns?
                - >
                    (Just please don't phrase it as “are you a boy or a girl?”.
                    This question implies that there's just two correct answers,
                    and it suggests unhealthy curiosity about someone's genitals.
                    Instead, you could just ask “what are your pronouns?” or “how should I refer to you?”)
                - >
                    It's also important to normalise simply telling people your pronouns when you introduce yourself.
                    “Hi, I'm Michæl, {/he=he/him}”. It's not hard – but for trans and nonbinary peopls it means so much!
                    It's even easier done online: just put your pronouns (or a link to examples from our website) to your bio.
                - >
                    Remember also that many people might use a different name and a different set of pronouns depending on situation.
                    They might not be out among friends or coworkers yet, but among friends be comfortable living their truth.
                    Be mindful. You might for instance ask them “which pronouns should I use in front of your boss?”, etc.
                - >
                    Some people give multiple pronouns, eg. “{/he&she=he/she}” or “{/they&he=they/he}”.
                    That means they like all of those forms. Usually, the first one is the preferred one.
        who-uses-it:
            question: 'Does anyone even use that?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Yes! Millions of enbies all around the world.
                    Every pronoun listed here has someone that actually uses it in everyday life.
        authority:
            question: 'Are those nonbinary pronouns approved by some kind of authority?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Language is not some kind of god-given, ancient magic set in stone.
                    It's just a tool that we use to communicate.
                    When we change as a society, and when the world around us changes,
                    we adjust the language we use to be able to better describe it.
                    We're its users, so <em>we're the authority</em> on how we want to use it.
                - >
                    Dictionaries take their time to start including those changes,
                    which doesn't make the change illegitimate in any way.
                    But eventually the new forms, if used often enough, get included in dictionaries.
                    {https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/singular-nonbinary-they=Merriam Webster}, for example,
                    accepts the use of {/they=singular “they”} as a nonbinary pronoun.
                - >
                    You can also read some {https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=neopronouns=academic papers}
                    on neopronouns.
        bio:
            question: 'Why should I put my pronouns in bio on social media?'
            answer:
                - >
                    If you're cis (= not trans) and you use „{/he=he}” or „{/she=she}” matching your gender,
                    you might think that your pronouns are <em>obvious</em>.
                    And yeah, maybe that's true – as long as your name is mentioned in the profile (and is traditionally male of female)
                    or if you have your picture as avatar.
                    Many people don't – so it's hard to guess how they want to be called.
                - >
                    But it's mostly about something more than that: your pronouns might be “obvious”,
                    but there are people whose pronouns are not.
                    They want to be addressed correctly, whether or not they “pass” as their gender,
                    whether or not they have transitioned (or if they want to transition at all).
                    Nonbinary people usually “don't look nonbinary”, we don't owe anyone androgyny.
                - >
                    Sharing our pronouns is very important for trans, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people.
                    Alas, it also exposes and singles us out.
                    But if cis people do the same, it means the world for us.
                    It makes us feel more confortable, safe and welcome

        change:
            question: 'Can I change my pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Of course! Nobody is surprised when someone changes their views, style, hobbies…
                    So why would it be strange that they discovered a part of their identity,
                    stopped liking their name, discovered a label that fits them well, etc.?
        get-used-to:
            question: 'Is it strange that I can''t get used to <em>my own</em> new pronouns?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Not at all! After many years of using pronouns congruent with one's gender assigned at birth
                    it's easy to forget oneself when switching to different ones.
                - >
                    Pronouns ≠ gender.
                    Your gender won't drastically change just because you got confused once when someone called you “them”.
                    Don't worry. Experiment. See what fits you best.
        preferred-pronouns:
            question: 'Why shouldn''t I say “preferred pronouns”?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because this phrase suggests that someone's pronouns are just a whim.
                    If someone just “prefers” to be called she, he won't _really_ feel bad, if I call him a “he”, right?
                    They look like a guy, after all, so it's gonna be easier for me!
                - >
                    No! It's our pronouns. Not our “preferred pronouns”. It's our names, not our “preferred names”.
                    If you care about your trans and nonbinary friends and loved ones, then call them the right way.
        gender-pronouns:
            question: 'Why shouldn''t I say “gender pronouns”?'
            answer:
                - >
                    Because gender ≠ pronouns. Pronouns are just grammar.
                    Nonbinary folks can use binary pronouns, some lesbians use {/he=he/him} for cultural reasons, etc.
                - >
                    Simply say “pronouns”.
